**# Autonomous Exploitation via Malware Injection using Raspberry Pi**

**## Abstract**
Cyber threats are evolving rapidly, with automated intrusion techniques posing significant risks to modern systems.  
This project explores **autonomous exploitation via malware injection using a Raspberry Pi**, demonstrating how small, low-cost devices can be leveraged for offensive cybersecurity research.  
The system autonomously scans, identifies vulnerabilities, and deploys malicious payloads to compromise target machines.  
Key components include network reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and malware execution, enabling hands-free exploitation with minimal human intervention.  
The study also discusses countermeasures and highlights the need for robust threat detection and mitigation strategies.

**## Objective**
- **Develop an Autonomous Exploitation Framework** – Create a Raspberry Pi-based system to scan, identify vulnerabilities, and inject malware.
- **Implement Script-Based Reconnaissance & Exploitation** – Use Python and Bash scripts for port scanning and automated exploitation.
- **Assess Security Vulnerabilities & Defense Gaps** – Analyze how autonomous attacks exploit system flaws.
- **Propose Countermeasures & Mitigation Strategies** – Recommend intrusion detection, mitigation, and proactive security measures.

## Problem Statement**
Attackers are leveraging automation and low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi to efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities.  
Traditional defenses often fail to detect **autonomous malware-driven attacks**, which raises a critical question:  
**How can autonomous exploitation bypass defenses, and what countermeasures can effectively mitigate such threats?**
